Intervion - AI-Based Interview System
Project Overview
Intervion is a backend system for an AI-powered interview platform. The platform enables candidates to participate in mock interviews, submit their answers, and receive AI-based feedback to improve their performance. The system uses the Google Gemini API to evaluate the answers and calculate the candidateâ€™s selection probability based on their responses.

This project is a Node.js application using Express.js and MongoDB to provide a robust backend solution.


Features
AI-Driven Interview System: Allows candidates to participate in mock interviews by answering role-specific questions asked by AI.
AI-Based Answer Evaluation: After each answer, the AI evaluates the response and provides concise and actionable feedback on how the candidate can improve.
Selection Probability: The system calculates the likelihood of the candidate getting selected based on their performance.
Interview Summary: Generates a summary of the interview after completion, including feedback and the selection probability.
Support for Multiple Roles: Candidates can choose different interview roles (e.g., Developer, Designer, Recruiter) and the system will generate questions specific to that role.

Tech Stack
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
Express.js: Web framework for building REST APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing candidate and interview data.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Document Mapper) to interact with MongoDB.
Google Gemini API: For evaluating candidate answers and generating AI-based feedback.
postman: For automatically generating and viewing API documentation.
JWT Authentication: For secure user authentication and authorization.
